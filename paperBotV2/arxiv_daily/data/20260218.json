    "ori_summary": "Modern digital services have evolved into indispensable tools, driving the present large-scale information systems. Yet, the prevailing platform-centric model, where services are optimized for platform-driven metrics such as engagement and conversion, often fails to align with users' true needs. While platform technologies have advanced significantly-especially with the integration of large language models (LLMs)-we argue that improvements in platform service quality do not necessarily translate to genuine user benefit. Instead, platform-centric services prioritize provider objectives over user welfare, resulting in conflicts against user interests. This paper argues that the future of digital services should shift from a platform-centric to a user-centric agent. These user-centric agents prioritize privacy, align with user-defined goals, and grant users control over their preferences and actions. With advancements in LLMs and on-device intelligence, the realization of this vision is now feasible. This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in transitioning to user-centric intelligence, presents a practical device-cloud pipeline for its implementation, and discusses the necessary governance and ecosystem structures for its adoption.",

    "ori_summary": "The scarcity of high-quality training data presents a fundamental bottleneck to scaling machine learning models. This challenge is particularly acute in recommendation systems, where extreme sparsity in user interactions leads to rugged optimization landscapes and poor generalization. We propose the Recursive Self-Improving Recommendation (RSIR) framework, a paradigm in which a model bootstraps its own performance without reliance on external data or teacher models. RSIR operates in a closed loop: the current model generates plausible user interaction sequences, a fidelity-based quality control mechanism filters them for consistency with user's approximate preference manifold, and a successor model is augmented on the enriched dataset. Our theoretical analysis shows that RSIR acts as a data-driven implicit regularizer, smoothing the optimization landscape and guiding models toward more robust solutions. Empirically, RSIR yields consistent, cumulative gains across multiple benchmarks and architectures. Notably, even smaller models benefit, and weak models can generate effective training curricula for stronger ones. These results demonstrate that recursive self-improvement is a general, model-agnostic approach to overcoming data sparsity, suggesting a scalable path forward for recommender systems and beyond.

However, this research line is severely limited by the lack of item-level environmental impact data in standard benchmarks. This paper introduces Eco-Amazon, a novel resource designed to bridge this gap. Our resource consists of an enriched version of three widely used Amazon datasets (i.e., Home, Clothing, and Electronics) augmented with Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) metadata. CO2e emission scores were generated using a zero-shot framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to estimate item-level PCF based on product attributes. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) the release of the Eco-Amazon datasets, enriching item metadata with PCF signals; (ii) the LLM-based PCF estimation script, which allows researchers to enrich any product catalogue and reproduce our results; (iii) a use case demonstrating how PCF estimates can be exploited to promote more sustainable products. By providing these environmental signals, Eco-Amazon enables the community to develop, benchmark, and evaluate the next generation of sustainable retrieval and recommendation models.

However, most of the current literature in the field relies on small- or medium-scale datasets that are either not publicly released or built using undocumented processes. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by releasing M3L-10M and M3L-20M, two large-scale, reproducible, multimodal datasets for the movie domain, obtained by enriching with multimodal features the popular MovieLens-10M and MovieLens-20M, respectively. By following a fully documented pipeline, we collect movie plots, posters, and trailers, from which textual, visual, acoustic, and video features are extracted using several state-of-the-art encoders. We publicly release mappings to download the original raw data, the extracted features, and the complete datasets in multiple formats, fostering reproducibility and advancing the field of MRSs. In addition, we conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses that showcase our datasets across several perspectives. This work represents a foundational step to ensure reproducibility and replicability in the large-scale, multimodal movie recommendation domain.

We present GaiaFlow, an innovative framework engineered to facilitate carbon-frugal search by operationalizing semantic-guided diffusion tuning. Our methodology orchestrates the convergence of retrieval-guided Langevin dynamics and a hardware-independent performance modeling strategy to optimize the trade-off between search precision and environmental preservation. By incorporating adaptive early exit protocols and precision-aware quantized inference, the proposed architecture significantly mitigates operational carbon footprints while maintaining robust retrieval quality across heterogeneous computing infrastructures.

Long-form cinematic titles, with their extended duration and complex narratives, challenge scene localization, while humor's reliance on diverse modalities and its nuanced style add further complexity. This paper introduces an end-to-end system for automatically identifying and ranking humorous scenes from long-form cinematic titles, featuring shot detection, multimodal scene localization, and humor tagging optimized for cinematic content. Key innovations include a novel scene segmentation approach combining visual and textual cues, improved shot representations via guided triplet mining, and a multimodal humor tagging framework leveraging both audio and text. Our system achieves an 18.3% AP improvement over state-of-the-art scene detection on the OVSD dataset and an F1 score of 0.834 for detecting humor in long text. Extensive evaluations across five cinematic titles demonstrate 87% of clips extracted by our pipeline are intended to be funny, while 98% of scenes are accurately localized. With successful generalization to trailers, these results showcase the pipeline's potential to enhance content creation workflows, improve user engagement, and streamline snackable content generation for diverse cinematic media formats.",

    "ori_summary": "Implicit feedback, such as user clicks, serves as the primary data source for modern recommender systems. However, click interactions inherently contain substantial noise, including accidental clicks, clickbait-induced interactions, and exploratory browsing behaviors that do not reflect genuine user preferences. Training recommendation models with such noisy positive samples leads to degraded prediction accuracy and unreliable recommendations. In this paper, we propose SAID (Semantics-Aware Implicit Denoising), a simple yet effective framework that leverages semantic consistency between user interests and item content to identify and downweight potentially noisy interactions. Our approach constructs textual user interest profiles from historical behaviors and computes semantic similarity with target item descriptions using pre-trained language model (PLM) based text encoders. The similarity scores are then transformed into sample weights that modulate the training loss, effectively reducing the impact of semantically inconsistent clicks. Unlike existing denoising methods that require complex auxiliary networks or multi-stage training procedures, SAID only modifies the loss function while keeping the backbone recommendation model unchanged. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID consistently improves recommendation performance, achieving up to 2.2% relative improvement in AUC over strong baselines, with particularly notable robustness under high noise conditions.",

In this paper, we reformulate Avey for the encoder-only paradigm and propose several innovations to its architecture, including decoupled static and dynamic parameterizations, stability-oriented normalization, and neural compression.

    "ori_summary": "Accurate representation of building semantics, encompassing both generic object types and specific subtypes, is essential for effective AI model training in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry. Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.",

This paper investigates the capacity of recent large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 variants and open-weight Mistral models, to address these tasks in few-shot and zero-shot settings for four historically and linguistically diverse under-resourced languages: Ancient Greek, Classical Armenian, Old Georgian, and Syriac. Using a novel benchmark comprising aligned training and out-of-domain test corpora, we evaluate the performance of foundation models across lemmatization and POS-tagging, and compare them with PIE, a task-specific RNN baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLMs, even without fine-tuning, achieve competitive or superior performance in POS-tagging and lemmatization across most languages in few-shot settings. Significant challenges persist for languages characterized by complex morphology and non-Latin scripts, but we demonstrate that LLMs are a credible and relevant option for initiating linguistic annotation tasks in the absence of data, serving as an effective aid for annotation.",

Estimating such effects requires researchers to run controlled experiments that systematically vary textual features. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for generating text, producing and evaluating controlled variation requires more careful attention. In this paper, we present an end-to-end pipeline for the generation and causal estimation of latent textual interventions. Our work first performs hypothesis generation and steering via sparse autoencoders (SAEs), followed by robust causal estimation. Our pipeline addresses both computational and statistical challenges in text-as-treatment experiments. We demonstrate that naive estimation of causal effects suffers from significant bias as text inherently conflates treatment and covariate information. We describe the estimation bias induced in this setting and propose a solution based on covariate residualization. Our empirical results show that our pipeline effectively induces variation in target features and mitigates estimation error, providing a robust foundation for causal effect estimation in text-as-treatment settings.",

Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.",

This assistant proactively communicates step-by-step instructions to a user performing a furniture assembly task, and answers user questions.

On observing that an off-the-shelf language model is a very talkative assistant, we design a novel User Whim Agnostic (UWA) LoRA finetuning method which improves the model's ability to suppress less informative dialogues, while maintaining its tendency to communicate important instructions. This leads to >30% improvement in the F-score. Finetuning the model also results in a 16x speedup by eliminating the need to provide in-context examples in the prompt.

In this paper, we introduce a content-based framework for designing and auditing cyber refusal policies that makes offense-defense tradeoffs explicit. The framework characterizes requests along five dimensions: Offensive Action Contribution, Offensive Risk, Technical Complexity, Defensive Benefit, and Expected Frequency for Legitimate Users, grounded in the technical substance of the request rather than stated intent.

In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles manifest differently across Frye's genres. Drawing on Jungian archetype theory, we derive four universal character functions (protagonist, mentor, antagonist, companion) by mapping them to Jung's psychic structure components. These functions are then specialized into sixteen genre-specific roles based on prototypical works. To validate this framework, we conducted a multi-model study using six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate character-role correspondences across 40 narrative works. The validation employed both positive samples (160 valid correspondences) and negative samples (30 invalid correspondences) to evaluate whether models both recognize valid correspondences and reject invalid ones. LLMs achieved substantial performance (mean balanced accuracy of 82.5%) with strong inter-model agreement (Fleiss' $κ$ = 0.600), demonstrating that the proposed correspondences capture systematic structural patterns. Performance varied by genre (ranging from 72.7% to 89.9%) and role (52.5% to 99.2%), with qualitative analysis revealing that variations reflect genuine narrative properties, including functional distribution in romance and deliberate archetypal subversion in satire. This character-based approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-supported methods for computational narratology and provides a foundation for future development of narrative generation methods and interactive storytelling applications.",

In practice, they often experience late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. We derive that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. Building on this result, we prove that training instability is driven by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\\%, which we term \\emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. Motivated by this observation, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO) for large-scale model refining, which selectively masks such updates and renormalizes the loss over valid tokens. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\\% over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.",

However, most existing works treat depression prediction either as a binary label or an overall severity score without explicitly modeling symptom-specific information. This limits their ability to provide symptom-level analysis relevant to clinical screening. To address this, we propose a symptom-specific and clinically inspired framework for depression severity estimation from speech. Our approach uses a symptom-guided cross-attention mechanism that aligns PHQ-8 questionnaire items with emotion-aware speech representations to identify which segments of a participant's speech are more important to each symptom. To account for differences in how symptoms are expressed over time, we introduce a learnable symptom-specific parameter that adaptively controls the sharpness of attention distributions. Our results on EDAIC, a standard clinical-style dataset, demonstrate improved performance outperforming prior works. Further, analyzing the attention distributions showed that higher attention is assigned to utterances containing cues related to multiple depressive symptoms, highlighting the interpretability of our approach. These findings outline the importance of symptom-guided and emotion-aware modeling for speech-based depression screening.",

    "ori_summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales model capacity while preserving computational efficiency through sparse expert activation. However, training high-quality MoEs from scratch is prohibitively expensive. A promising alternative is to convert pretrained dense models into sparse MoEs. Existing dense-to-MoE methods fall into two categories: \\textbf{dynamic structural pruning} that converts dense models into MoE architectures with moderate sparsity to balance performance and inference efficiency, and \\textbf{downcycling} approaches that use pretrained dense models to initialize highly sparse MoE architectures. However, existing methods break the intrinsic activation patterns within dense models, leading to suboptimal expert construction. In this work, we argue that the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) mechanism provides a natural blueprint for dense-to-MoE conversion. We show that the fine-grained neural-wise activation patterns of GLU reveal a coarse-grained structure, uncovering an inherent MoE architecture composed of consistently activated universal neurons and dynamically activated specialized neurons. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce ExpertWeaver, a training-free framework that partitions neurons according to their activation patterns and constructs shared experts and specialized routed experts with layer-adaptive configurations. Our experiments demonstrate that ExpertWeaver significantly outperforms existing methods, both as a training-free dynamic structural pruning technique and as a downcycling strategy for superior MoE initialization.",

We introduce DependencyAI, a simple and interpretable approach for detecting AI-generated text using only the labels of linguistic dependency relations. Our method achieves competitive performance across monolingual, multi-generator, and multilingual settings. To increase interpretability, we analyze feature importance to reveal syntactic structures that distinguish AI-generated from human-written text. We also observe a systematic overprediction of certain models on unseen domains, suggesting that generator-specific writing styles may affect cross-domain generalization. Overall, our results demonstrate that dependency relations alone provide a robust signal for AI-generated text detection, establishing DependencyAI as a strong linguistically grounded, interpretable, and non-neural network baseline.",

To address this gap, we propose Fine-Refine, a fine-grained refinement framework that decomposes responses into atomic units, verifies each unit using external knowledge, assesses fluency via perplexity, and iteratively corrects granular errors. We evaluate factuality across the HybriDialogue and OpendialKG datasets in terms of factual accuracy (fact score) and coverage (Not Enough Information Proportion), and experiments show that Fine-Refine substantially improves factuality, achieving up to a 7.63-point gain in dialogue fact score, with a small trade-off in dialogue quality.",

While primarily studied in clinical settings, online patient platforms like medical subreddits may hold complementary insights: treatment expectations that patients feel unnecessary or uncomfortable to share elsewhere. Despite this, no studies examine what type of expectations users discuss online and how they express them. Presumably this is because expectations have not been studied in natural language processing (NLP) before. Therefore, we introduce the task of Expectation Detection, arguing that expectations are relevant for many applications, including opinion mining and product design. Subsequently, we present a case study for the medical domain, where expectations are particularly crucial to extract. We contribute RedHOTExpect, a corpus of Reddit posts (4.5K posts) to study expectations in this context. We use a large language model (LLM) to silver-label the data and validate its quality manually (label accuracy ~78%). Based on this, we analyze which linguistic patterns characterize expectations and explore what patients expect and why. We find that optimism and proactive framing are more pronounced in posts about physical or treatment-related illnesses compared to mental-health contexts, and that in our dataset, patients mostly discuss benefits rather than negative outcomes.

In these scenarios, LLM agents govern the information users receive, by drawing users' attention to particular instances of retrieved information at the expense of others. While much prior work has focused on biases in the information LLMs themselves generate, less attention has been paid to the factors that influence what information LLMs select and present to users. We hypothesize that when information is attributed to specific sources (e.g., particular publishers, journals, or platforms), current LLMs exhibit systematic latent source preferences- that is, they prioritize information from some sources over others. Through controlled experiments on twelve LLMs from six model providers, spanning both synthetic and real-world tasks, we find that several models consistently exhibit strong and predictable source preferences. These preferences are sensitive to contextual framing, can outweigh the influence of content itself, and persist despite explicit prompting to avoid them. They also help explain phenomena such as the observed left-leaning skew in news recommendations in prior work. Our findings advocate for deeper investigation into the origins of these preferences, as well as for mechanisms that provide users with transparency and control over the biases guiding LLM-powered agents.",

Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code.

Prior work extracted more than 350K mentions of leisure time activities and organizational memberships from these interviews, yielding 71K unique activity and organization names -- far too many to analyze directly. We develop a categorization framework that captures key aspects of participation (the kind of activity/organization, how social it typically is, how regularly it happens, and how physically demanding it is). We annotate a gold-standard set to allow for a reliable evaluation, and then test whether large language models can apply the same schema at scale. Using a simple voting approach across multiple model runs, we find that an open-weight LLM can closely match expert judgments. Finally, we apply the method to label the 350K entities, producing a structured resource for downstream studies of social integration and related outcomes.",

To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.",

While latent state transfer offers a high-bandwidth alternative, existing approaches either assume homogeneous sender-receiver architectures or rely on pair-specific learned translators, limiting scalability and modularity across diverse model families with disjoint manifolds. In this work, we propose the Vision Wormhole, a novel framework that repurposes the visual interface of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable model-agnostic, text-free communication. By introducing a Universal Visual Codec, we map heterogeneous reasoning traces into a shared continuous latent space and inject them directly into the receiver's visual pathway, effectively treating the vision encoder as a universal port for inter-agent telepathy. Our framework adopts a hub-and-spoke topology to reduce pairwise alignment complexity from O(N^2) to O(N) and leverages a label-free, teacher-student distillation objective to align the high-speed visual channel with the robust reasoning patterns of the text pathway. Extensive experiments across heterogeneous model families (e.g., Qwen-VL, Gemma) demonstrate that the Vision Wormhole reduces end-to-end wall-clock time in controlled comparisons while maintaining reasoning fidelity comparable to standard text-based MAS.

To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors.

We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks.

While efficient, such System-1-style retrieval struggles with scenarios that require global reasoning or comprehensive coverage of all relevant information. In this work, We propose Mnemis, a novel memory framework that integrates System-1 similarity search with a complementary System-2 mechanism, termed Global Selection. Mnemis organizes memory into a base graph for similarity retrieval and a hierarchical graph that enables top-down, deliberate traversal over semantic hierarchies. By combining the complementary strength from both retrieval routes, Mnemis retrieves memory items that are both semantically and structurally relevant. Mnemis achieves state-of-the-art performance across all compared methods on long-term memory benchmarks, scoring 93.9 on LoCoMo and 91.6 on LongMemEval-S using GPT-4.1-mini.",

This study introduces the Linguistic eXtractor (LX), a fine-tuned, large language model trained on consumer-authored text that also has been labeled with consumers' self-reported ratings of 16 consumption-related emotions and four evaluation constructs: trust, commitment, recommendation, and sentiment. LX consistently outperforms leading models, including GPT-4 Turbo, RoBERTa, and DeepSeek, achieving 81% macro-F1 accuracy on open-ended survey responses and greater than 95% accuracy on third-party-annotated Amazon and Yelp reviews. An application of LX to online retail data, using seemingly unrelated regression, affirms that review-expressed emotions predict product ratings, which in turn predict purchase behavior. Most emotional effects are mediated by product ratings, though some emotions, such as discontent and peacefulness, influence purchase directly, indicating that emotional tone provides meaningful signals beyond star ratings. To support its use, a no-code, cost-free, LX web application is available, enabling scalable analyses of consumer-authored text. In establishing a new methodological foundation for consumer perception measurement, this research demonstrates new methods for leveraging large language models to advance marketing research and practice, thereby achieving validated detection of marketing constructs from consumer data.",

We focus on the important special case of representations that define softmax distributions. In this case, we argue that the natural geometry is information geometry. Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop \"dual steering\", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes. We prove that dual steering optimally modifies the target concept while minimizing changes to off-target concepts. Empirically, we find that dual steering enhances the controllability and stability of concept manipulation.",

To study these effects in a controlled setting, we present FrameRef, a large-scale dataset of 1,073,740 systematically reframed claims across five framing dimensions: authoritative, consensus, emotional, prestige, and sensationalist, and propose a simulation-based framework for modeling sequential information exposure and reinforcement dynamics characteristic of ranking and recommendation systems. Within this framework, we construct framing-sensitive agent personas by fine-tuning language models with framing-conditioned loss attenuation, inducing targeted biases while preserving overall task competence. Using Monte Carlo trajectory sampling, we show that small, systematic shifts in acceptance and confidence can compound over time, producing substantial divergence in cumulative information health trajectories. Human evaluation further confirms that FrameRef's generated framings measurably affect human judgment. Together, our dataset and framework provide a foundation for systematic information health research through simulation, complementing and informing responsible human-centered research.

In particular, collecting large-scale manipulation data via real-world teleoperation is expensive and difficult to scale. While learning in simulation provides a feasible alternative, designing multiple task-specific environments and rewards for training is similarly challenging. We propose Dex4D, a framework that instead leverages simulation for learning task-agnostic dexterous skills that can be flexibly recomposed to perform diverse real-world manipulation tasks. Specifically, Dex4D learns a domain-agnostic 3D point track conditioned policy capable of manipulating any object to any desired pose. We train this 'Anypose-to-Anypose' policy in simulation across thousands of objects with diverse pose configurations, covering a broad space of robot-object interactions that can be composed at test time. At deployment, this policy can be zero-shot transferred to real-world tasks without finetuning, simply by prompting it with desired object-centric point tracks extracted from generated videos. During execution, Dex4D uses online point tracking for closed-loop perception and control. Extensive experiments in simulation and on real robots show that our method enables zero-shot deployment for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks and yields consistent improvements over prior baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong generalization to novel objects, scene layouts, backgrounds, and trajectories, highlighting the robustness and scalability of the proposed framework.",

However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.",

We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\\% vs.\\ 62.5\\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.",

However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \\pm 1.5$ ($\\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \\pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \\pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \\times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \\pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \\pm 0.5$.",

A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days.

In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.",

Recent methods adapt text-to-image models to this task using a single Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, but they face a fundamental limitation: attempting to capture the diverse space of visual transformations within a fixed adaptation module constrains generalization capabilities. Inspired by recent work showing that LoRAs in constrained domains span meaningful, interpolatable semantic spaces, we propose LoRWeB, a novel approach that specializes the model for each analogy task at inference time through dynamic composition of learned transformation primitives, informally, choosing a point in a \"space of LoRAs\". We introduce two key components: (1) a learnable basis of LoRA modules, to span the space of different visual transformations, and (2) a lightweight encoder that dynamically selects and weighs these basis LoRAs based on the input analogy pair. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves generalization to unseen visual transformations.

However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.",

While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\\% accuracy (+1.64 \\%) with 39.4\\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.",

    "ori_summary": "Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.",

First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking.

Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.",

Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.",

The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.",

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.",

During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel \"Castle-Moat-Rampart\" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.",

    "ori_summary": "General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra",

Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability.

However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.",

First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.",

Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.",

Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.",

We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.",

    "ori_summary": "Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.",

    "ori_summary": "The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.",

    "ori_summary": "Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.
